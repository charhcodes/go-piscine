# go-piscine
01 FOUNDERS GO PISCINE FULL ANSWERS

Project Description:

This is a collection of short coding tasks implemented as part of 01 Founders' 3-week hands-on Go intensive, in which I was taken from no coding experience to intermediate Go fluency. The tasks are designed to be straightforward yet progressively challenging, which helped me gain confidence and understanding as I worked through them. The custom package created by 01 Founders 'piscine' was used throughout, so as to stop students from using external packages and imports, resulting in pure Go being used to complete almost all tasks. 

How to Install and Run:

N/A. This is because the tasks were tested through the 01 Founders software which determined whether the task was correctly answered or not, according to their guidelines. All tasks included were answered correctly (of course).

Acknowledgments:

Special thanks to 01 Founders for setting this up and helping me massively during my coding journey. I would not have been able to complete any of my projects if it weren't for this 3 week intensive!
